# Audiofingerprint

This code implements the audio fingerprint from [Kalker, Haitsma - "A Highly Robust Audio Fingerprinting System"](http://www.nhchau.com/files/AudioFingerprint-02-FP04-2.pdf), albeit currently without the database search.



*This repository was created after fiddling about with the ideas in my fiddles repository. It thus does not contain all the commits I did while creaing the initial prototype.*
